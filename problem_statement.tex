Going on a long distance journey is difficult in Kenya if you do not own a car. The public means of transport are inconvenient and unreliable. During holidays, most people are stranded as the prices are hicked, as the demands exceeds the supply. Apart from the Matatus most people prefer to hire cars. It is expensive because they end up hiring the car for the days they will be away.

This is a big problem to the youths since most of them do not own cars and cannot afford to hire cars. The price of fuel has been increasing making transportation generally expensive for most people.

There is a need to connect people who are willing to share their cars with passengers. Currently private car drivers fear driving to the bus stations and pick passengers because they will spend a lot of time because of congestion at bus stations. Also only authorized vehicles are allowed to pick passengers at the bus stations.

Passengers have a need to access private cars that are travelling from and to their destination. They need this information earlier so that they can prepare and plan their journey well.
