\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Background}

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

Going on a long distance journey is difficult in Kenya if you do not own a car. The public means of transport are inconvenient and unreliable. During holidays, most people are stranded as the prices are hicked, as the demands exceeds the supply. Apart from the Matatus most people prefer to hire cars. It is expensive because they end up hiring the car for the days they will be away.

This is a big problem to the youths since most of them do not own cars and cannot afford to hire cars.

\subsubsection{Objectives}

Develop a distributed system that will help solve this problem :-

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Connect Drivers and Riders using the system
    \item Onboard a car owner to offer services
    \item Drivers to post about their trips
\end{enumerate}
