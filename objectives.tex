\begin{enumerate}
    \item Connect Drivers and Riders using the system
    \item Onboard a car owner to offer services
    \item Drivers to post about their trips and accept passenger requests
    \item Drivers to set their fare prices
    \item Passengers to send requests for rides
\end{enumerate}
