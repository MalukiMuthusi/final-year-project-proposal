% about car pooling
Carsharing began in the US during the World War II,~\cite{Ferguson1997}. The government encouraged carsharing to save rubber and fuel resources to be used in the war effort. Workers were incouraged to use the same car to and from work. The system in place was notice board based.

After the war carpooling services declined. The services later emerged during the 1970s due to the oil crisis. During this time corporates established internet notice boards and telephone-based computerized ridematching.

In the recent years there has been an increased interest in ridesharing services. These are built on internet and GPS-smartphones. These services have transformed the industry. They have put innovation into the transit services.

It is estimated that in the next decade there will be a greater intergration of services, technology and policy support for ridesharing,~\cite{Chan2012}. This is due to concerns for energy, congestion, climate change and dependency on oil.
